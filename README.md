# ARK: Server Utility
ARK: Survival Evolved's dedicated server' utility application.

# Detail
This is a software for setting up a dedicated server for ARK: Survial Evolved.  
There is other similar software available, but I think it is more capable. ï¼ˆIt is still in the development stage.)

# System
By using C#WPF to create the GUI, and writing the main code in Python, we can easily create a GUI application.  
Issues and pull requests are welcome. I would be very happy if you could add a brief explanation so that I can understand it.

# Install
I will publish them in Release.  
For now, I will not release it.  
If you want to try it out, please clone and build it yourself.  
(Development environment: Windows11 - 64bit/VisualStudio2022)
